    <subject>IMPORTANT Matchmaker Registration Info</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear     ,
Thank you for registering for CT Business Matchmaker 2016! 
UPDATE YOUR PROFILE
We are continuing to use Eventdex’s MatchLeads registration system this year. This system allows small businesses to sign up for their Matchmaker appointments during small business registration in April and May. This means that you will have a detailed list of your small business meeting schedule ahead of time. Our objective is to create a more efficient and productive event for all.
To assist small businesses in determining the best fits for their meetings, please make sure that you have completed your registration with a company description and a succinct, yet comprehensive list of procurement opportunities available. You may update these items online until April 8:
•	Visit [link]
•	Sign up using the email address: [address]
•	Password should not contain the first 4 characters of your email address
•	After logging in, please complete your Contact and Company Profiles. Small businesses will use this information to assess whether or not to set up an appointment with you. Details will help bring in better matches.
